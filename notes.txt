Session 1 notes - introduction
- big data = structured or unstructured data difficult to process using standard techniques
- capture > store > analyse
- database = data storage
- SQL = for data access and processing
- examples of common streams
	- software engineering: programming and development
	- data analysis: data science and processing
- data science steps
	- frame the problem to solve
	- collect and store raw data
	- process the data
	- explore the data
	- in-depth analysis
	- communicate and visualise results
- database
	- multiple tables within database, can relate to one another
- relational database model RDBM
	- stores data in tables, which relates pieces of data to one another
	- tables
		- consist of rows (often called records) and columns
		- junction table: combinations of other tables, e.g. which employee is in which department, 
		cannot exist without employee or department tables
		- need to specify constraints per column: type of data (mandatory), size of data, format, 
		required (not null) or not (null)
		- NULL value - process cell without data without problems, must explicitly include
		- data types (more info here: https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_datatypes.asp)
			- char(size) i.e. fixed length string, can be from 0 to 255, 1 by default
			- varchar(size) i.e. variable length string, can be from 0 to 65535
			- binary
			- float(p) where p is precision
			- decimal(m,d) where m is total digits and d is digits after decimal
			- boolean where 0 is FALSE and all other values are TRUE
			- date i.e. YYYY-MM-DD
			- time i.e. HH:MM:SS
			- timestamp i.e. YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
	- attribute = property of an object, e.g. data hired, date of birth, can identify using an attribute
	- many to many relationships allowed, e.g. can have many salaries to account for pay rise
	- https://coderpad.io/sandbox
- relational database management system RDBMS
	- program to create, update and administer a relational db_name
	- SQL (Structured Query Language) most commonly used language
	- MySQL
		- most popular open source SQL db
		- easy to use, inexpensive, reliable, large community
		- poor performance when scaling, open source dev slow, missing some advanced features
		- controlled by Oracle
	- PostgreSQL
		- open source, not controlled by any corporation, used for web app dev
		- easy to use, inexpensive, reliable, large community, some additional features
		- slower performance, not as commonly offered as managed instance
	- Oracle DB
		- close source (Oracle)
		- large apps (banking - prebuilt functionality)
		- expensive
	- SQL Server
		- close source (Microsoft)
		- large enterprise apps
		- expensive
	- SQLite
		- open source
		- can store an entire db in a single file so data can be stored locally e.g. db in mobile phone
- https://coderpad.io/sandbox to practice online
- data in db
	- should be singular source of truth
	- should be easy to query
	- want to manage and maintain data efficiently
	- want to persist data and keep it safe
- query syntax
	keyword identifier keyword identifier;
- SELECT syntax
	- SELECT column_name1, column_name2 FROM table_name;
	- SELECT * FROM table_name; where * is a wildcard character to select all columns from a table
	- SELECT table.column1, table.column2 FROM table;
	- SELECT t.column1, t.column2 FROM table t;
	- can alias a table using ... FROM table t;
- CREATE DATABASE and USE db syntax
	- CREATE DATABASE db_name; not SQL standard
	- USE db_name;
	  SELECT * FROM table_name;
	- SELECT * FROM db_name.table_name;
- CREATE TABLE syntax
	- CREATE TABLE table_name (column1 INTEGER, column2 VARCHAR(50), column3 VARCHAR(50), column4 INTEGER); 
	define name and type at min
- INSERT INTO syntax
	- populate tables with data, i.e. add new rows of data
	- keep names clear and user-friendly
	- INSERT INTO table_name (col1, col2, col3) VALUES (val1, val2, val3);
- INSERT INTO syntax pt 2
	- insert multiple rows with one statement
	- INSERT INTO table_name (col1, col2, col3) VALUES (val1,val2,val3), (val4,val5,val6), (val7,val8,val9);

Session 2 notes - SQL and db management techniques
- DISTINCT
	- keyword requesting a unique set of results
	- SELECT DISTINCT alias.column_name FROM table_name alias;
- WHERE
	- checks for conditions to match for results to qualify
	- comes after FROM
	- Boolean expression, such as =, !=, >, < etc.
	- SELECT alias.column_name FROM table_name alias WHERE alias.column_name = 'value';
- database normalisation
	- create table about one specific topic only (nonstructured data -> structured data)
	- benefits
		- minimise duplicate data
		- minimise/avoid data modification issues
		- simplify queries
		- i.e. reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity
		- + reduce data complexity, ensure relationship between tables as well as data, 
		ensure data dependecies and data are logically stored
	- common forms 
		- 1st (or 1NF)
			- contains only automic values (i.e. one value per cell)
			- each record is unique, no repeating groups (i.e. table doesn't contain 2 or more
			values of columns that are closely related)
		- 2nd (or 2NF)
			- 1NF
			- no partial dependency of any column on primary key
			- all non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on primary key
		- 3rd (or 3NF)
			- 2NF
			- no transitive functional dependency, i.e. table 1 dependent on table 2 and table 2
			dependent on table 3 is transitive dependence, which isn't allowed to occur
			- benefits: data integrity, no data duplication
		- Boyce-Codd (or BCNF or 3.5NF)
			- used to handle anomalies which are not accounted for in 3NF
			- all redundancy based on functional dependecy removed
- SQL constraint types
	- constraints = rules to restrict type of data in a table
	- ensure accuracy and reliability of data in table
	- can be set at column or table level
	- constraint violation > action aborted
	- CREATE TABLE table_name (col1 Type, col2 Type, col3 Type, 
	CONSTRAINT contstraint_name constraint_type (col_that_it_applies_to));
	- CREATE TABLE customers (customer_id INTEGER, name VARCHAR(50), 
	surname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, telephone INTEGER CONSTRAINT pk_customer_id PRIMARY KEY (customer_id));
	- NOT NULL
		- once applied, cannot pass a null value to the column
		- cannot be defined at table level
		- CREATE TABLE table_name (col1 INTEGER NOT NULL, col2 VARCHAR(50));
	- UNIQUE
		- column must only have unique values, i.e. duplicate values not allowed
		- can be applied at column or table level
		- CREATE TABLE table_name (col1 INTEGER NOT NULL UNIQUE, col2 VARCHAR(50));
		- ALTER TABLE table_name ADD UNIQUE (col1);
	- CHECK
		- restrict value of a column between a range
		- CREATE TABLE table_name (col1 INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (col1 > 0), col2 VARCHAR(50));
		- ALTER TABLE table_name ADD CHECK (col1 > 0);
	- DEFAULT
		- set default value for column
		- CREATE TABLE table_name (col1 INTEGER NOT NULL UNIQUE, col2 VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'value');
	- PRIMARY KEY
		= unique identifier of row per table, can be used to refer to other tables
		- cannot be null
		- must be unique
		- can be single or multiple columns (called compound key)
		- can be defined in CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE statements as PRIMARY KEY
		- CREATE TABLE table_name (col1 Type KEY DEFINITION, col2 Type, col3 Type);
		- CREATE TABLE customers (customer_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(50), 
		surname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, telephone INTEGER);
		- CREATE TABLE table_name (col1 Type, col2 Type, CONSTRAINT pk_name PRIMARY KEY col1);
	- FOREIGN KEY
		- relates two tables, refers to a column (often primary key) in a different table
		- restricts actions that would destroy links between tables
		- enforces referential integrity, reinforces relationships between tables (parent/referenced 
		and child/referencing tables)
		- can be non-unique
		- allows null values
		- called recursive/self-referencing foreign key if primary key and foreign key in same table
		- to insert foreign key value into child table, that value must be present in parent table
		- table can have more than one foreign key, and each can refer to a different parent table
		- when record deleted in parent table 
			- ON DELETE CASCADE - remove record from child table
			- ON DELETE SET NULL - set record to NULL in child table
			- otherwise not allowed to delete in parent table
		- define ON DELETE and ON UPDATE actions
			- CASCADE - push change from parent table to child table
			- SET NULL - if value changed in parent table, set to NULL in child table
			- RESTRICT - parent value cannot be edited, default
		- CREATE TABLE table_name (col1 Type PRIMARY KEY, col2 Type, 
		col3 Type FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES table_name2 (col2) ON UPDATE CASCADE ON DELETE CASCADE);
		- ALTER TABLE table_name ADD CONSTRAINT constraint_name FOREIGN KEY (col_that_it_applies_to)
		REFERENCES table_name2 (col2_that_it_applies_to);
		- ALTER TABLE table_name DROP FOREIGN KEY constraint_name; to drop foreign key
		- SET foreign_key_checks = 0; to disable foreign key checks
		- SET foreign_key_check = 1; to enable foreign key checks
- data integrity
	- parent table with unique primary keys
	- referential integrity - aggregate information across sources
	- child table with its own primary key and a foreign key to link back to parent table
- database relationships
	- one to one
	- one to many
	- many to many
	- many to one
- core commands DDL
	- DDL = Data Definition Language
	- subset of SQL statements that change structure of db schema
	- CREATE
	- ALTER TABLE
		- change an existing table, add/remove columns, change data type, change constraints
		- must agree with current data
		- ALTER TABLE table_name ADD CONSTRAINT constraint_name constraint_type (col_that_it_applies_to)
		REFERENCES table_name2 (col2_that_it_applies_to);
		- ALTER TABLE table_name MODIFY COLUMN column Type;
	- DROP TABLE
		- removes table and all associated data
		- error if table is a foreign key to another table
		- DROP TABLE table_name;
	- TRUNCATE
	- COMMENT
	- RENAME
- DML commands
	- DML = Data Manipulation Language
	- SELECT
	- INSERT
	- UPDATE
		- modify columns in a single table
		- use SET and WHERE keywords
		- UPDATE table_name SET table_name.col1 = new_value WHERE table_name.col2 = value;

Session 3 notes - data analysis
- comparison operators
	- relational opearators that compare values of operands
	- returns True or False
	- <, >, <=, >=, =, != or <>
- condition keywords
	- AND, OR, IS NOT (only used for NULL)
	- SELECT alias.column FROM table_name alias WHERE alias.column = condition
	AND alias.column2 > condition OR alias.column IS NOT NULL;
- logical operators
	- searching for patterns or searching without exact search criteria
	- BETWEEN, NOT BETWEEN - values within a range
	- LIKE - character string matching a specified pattern using % to indicate
	other characters
		- wildcard % - zero, one or however many characters
		- wildcard _ - only one single character
		- LIKE '%m' - any string ending with 'm'
		- LIKE 'm__%' - any string beginning with 'm' and at least three characters long
		- LIKE 'm%t' - any string beginning with 'm' and ending with 't'
	- IN - multiple values included in a WHERE clause
	- IS - similar to equals, to be used when values may be NULL
	- SELECT alias.column FROM table_name alias 
	WHERE alias.column BETWEEN value1 AND value2;
	- SELECT alias.column FROM table_name alias 
	WHERE alias.column LIKE 'M%';
	- SELECT alias.column FROM table_name alias 
	WHERE alias.column IN (value1, value2, value3);
- aggregation and order
	- organise, understand, interpret and analyse data
	- ORDER BY
		- used with SELECT, comes after WHERE
		- need to specify one or more columns to order by, must be present in SELECT clause as well
		- ASC and DESC, ASC by default
		- SELECT alias.column FROM table_name alias ORDER BY table_name.column;
	- set functions
		- 'helper' functions, used in place of columns in SELECT clause
		- compute a new value from passed columns
		- often use DISTINCT 
		- COUNT - count all column values specified, includes NULL values if * used,
		* used to count all rows which fit into groups
		- MAX - excludes NULL
		- MIN - excludes NULL
		- SUM - excludes NULL
		- AVG - average of all values in column, excludes NULL
		- LISTAG - transforms values from a group of rows into a delimited string
		- and many others, incl. trig and log functions such as sin, cos, tan, asin,
		sinh, cosh, tanh, log(base, value), ln(value)
		- SELECT SUM(alias.column) FROM table_name alias;
		- SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT alias.column) FROM table_name alias;
	- GROUP BY
		- groups rows that have same values
		- allows multiple columns with a set function - breaks results into subsets,
		runs set function against each subset, returns 1 row of results per subset
		- summarises data
		- columns specified in GROUP BY must appear in SELECT clause
		- SELECT COUNT(alias.column), alias.column FROM table_name alias 
		GROUP BY alias.column;
	- HAVING
		- WHERE cannot be used with aggregate functions -> HAVING added
		- filters records that work on summarised GROUP BY results
		- WHERE and HAVING can be used in same query
		- SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT alias.column) alias.column FROM table_name alias
		GROUP BY alias.column HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT alias.column) > value;
	- GROUP BY aggregates data and creates subsets, HAVING restricts GROUP BY
- homework

	- finish shop queries - done

##############################################################################################################
Session 4 - data analysis for complex structures
- JOIN
	- combines columns from two or more tables, based on a related column between them
	into a single result set
	- can only join columns of same data type
	- can do multiple JOIN statements in one query
	- INNER JOIN
		- returns rows when there is at least one match in both tables
		- only returns rows in common between tables
		- doesn't accept NULL values
		- SELECT alias1.column, alias2.column FROM table1 alias1 
		INNER JOIN table2 alias2 ON alias1.column = alias2.column;
	- LEFT OUTER JOIN or LEFT JOIN
		- all rows from the left side with the matching rows from right side returned
		- gives NULL if no values matching in right table
		- SELECT alias1.column, alias1.column, alias2.column FROM table1 alias1 
		LEFT JOIN table2 alias2 ON alias1.column = alias2.column;
	- RIGHT OUTER JOIN or RIGHT JOIN

		- returns NULL if no values match
		- equivalent to LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN
		- doesn't work in MySQL
	- CROSS JOIN
		- matches all rows to all rows - returns cartesian product
		- SELECT alias1.column, alias1.column, alias2.column FROM table1 alias1 
		CROSS JOIN table2 alias2 ON alias1.column = alias2.column;

- UNION
	- combines two or more result sets of queries into a single result set
	- tables get longer, not wider
	- stacks tables on top of each other (doesn't create longer rows)
	- tables must have same columns in same order, doesn't match on a specific column
	- by default excludes duplicate rows (only includes it once)
	- UNION ALL to retain duplicate rows
- subquery
	- nested query where results of one query used in another query using a relational
	operator or aggregation function
	- must be in parentheses
	- can only have one column in SELECT clause if used in WHERE clause
	- ORDER BY clause not allowed in subquery

##############################################################################################################
Session 5 - data manipulation with SQL	
- functions
	- built-in and user-defined
	- piece of code performs operations and returns a result
	- most common types: string functions, numeric functions, date functions
	- when used with SELECT statement, data not changed
	- used with UPDATE statement to update data using a function
	- built-in examples:
		- length()
		- upper()
		- lower()
		- concat()
		- date_format()
		- cast()
		- trim()
		- reverse()
		- now()
		- power()
- transactions
	- manilupating data and retaining changes
	- unit of work that is performed against a database in a logical way
	- after a transaction
		- commit > apply change to db
		- roll back > do not retain change
	- only complete if each part of operation fully successful
	- prevents partial operations from being committed to db
	- maintain referential data integrity, minimise data errors
	- MySQL automatically commits (SET autocommit to ON or OFF)
	- START TRANSACTION; / BEGIN; / BEGIN WORK;
	run code
	COMMIT; / ROLLBACK;
	- cannot rollback after you commit
- using IF statements
	- IF(condition, variable i.e. column, what to display if condition not fulfiled)
	- IF(balance > 0, balance, 0)
- variables
	- SET @variablename = value
- table locking
	- prevent other users from being able to editing/viewing a table
	- ensure data integrity
	- read lock 
		- can read but cannot write
		- automatically terminated when session ends
		- write operations from other sessions queued until lock released
		- can be held by mutliple sessions - e.g. a team
		- shared lock
	- LOCK TABLE table_name READ;
	update
	UNLOCK TABLE;
	- write lock
		- table not visible to other users
		- can only be held by one session
		- exclusive lock
	- LOCK TABLE table_name WRITE;

##############################################################################################################
Session 6 - data management using SQL coding techniques
- views
	- virtual table based on result of SQL statement
	- do not store data, virtual snapshot of representation of a table
	- view info without directly accessing db > cannot access other info in db
	- based off base tables
	- can have nested views
	- allow for GDPR and security restrictions by using WHERE clauses
	- CREATE VIEW view_name AS SELECT query...
	- updates
		- updatable for simple queries > can update data not visible through view >
		view inconsistent
		- not updatable for complex queries
	- with check option
		- prevent modifying/inserting a row in such a way that it would no longer 
		be part of the view result
		- ensure consistency of data
	- doesn't store any data, just query definition
- 4 types of stored programs
	- stored procedure
	- stored function
	- trigger
	- event
- stored procedures
	- subroutine available to applications that access a rdbs
	- one or more SQL statements
	- used for data validation and access control methods
	- called sproc or procedures
	- can pass multiple parameters
	- advantages
		- can be reused
		- decrease in network traffic
		- encapsulation of business logic
		- delegation of access rights
		- protection from SQL injection
		- transaction management
		- improved performance
	- DELIMITER // 
	CREATE PROCEDURE proc_name (input_parameters TYPE)
	BEGIN
		DECLARE variable;
		proc_logic
	END //
	DELIMITER ;
	CALL proc_name(input_parameters);
	- set delimiter since ; may need to be used within the procedure definition
	- can have multiple begin/end statements
	- output can be a table
- stored functions
	- executable db object with SQL procedural code
	- also called user defined functions
	- cannot modify db by INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE statements
	- MySQL > scalar functions only > single value returned
	- can be used in SELECT statements
	- DELIMITER // 
	CREATE FUNCTION func_name (param TYPE)
	RETURNS TYPE
	BEGIN
		DECLARE variable;
		func_logic
		RETURN(result)
	END //
	DELIMITER ;
	CALL func_name(input_parameters);
- comparison between procedures and functions
	- procedure: returns many values, input and output parameters, can't be used in
	SELECT, can call functions, may not return value, read and modify data, 
	INSERT/SELECT/UPDATE/DELETE, transaction management
	- function: returns one value, input parameters only, can be used in
	SELECT, cannot call procedures, must return value, read data only, 
	SELECT only, no transaction management
- AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY
	- to automatically increate value of primary key by one when adding in rows
- triggers
	- blocks of code executed automatically when DML operations are executed
	(e.g. INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
	- trigger execution called trigger firing
	- format
		- FOR EACH ROW clause for a row-level trigger
		- OLD keyword gets a value from row that is being updated/deleted
		- NEW keyword gets a value from row that is being inserted/updated
		- note: NEW for INSERT and UPDATE and OLD for UPDATE and DELETE
	- enforce rules for data consistency and integrity
	- maintain the audit table
	- 2 types
		- before trigger
		- after trigger
	- when updating the same table trigger is based on:
	CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name
	BEFORE/AFTER INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE
	ON table_name 
	FOR EACH ROW
	trigger body e.g. SET NEW.updated = curdate();
	- when updating a different table, include UPDATE statement:
	CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name
	BEFORE/AFTER INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE
	ON table_name 
	FOR EACH ROW
	UPDATE table_name2
	trigger body e.g. SET NEW.updated = curdate();
	- include UPDATE table_name2 statement only if updating a different table
	- can use BEGIN END without triggers to include multiple statements
	- remember to use NEW/OLD keywords
- events
	- blocks of code executed automatically according to event scheduler
	- event execution called event firing
	- 2 types
		- one time
		- recurring
	- maintenance tasks
	- to show existing events:
	SHOW PROCESSLIST;
	SHOW EVENTS FROM db;
	- to create an event:
	CREATE EVENT [IF NOT EXISTS] event_name
	ON SCHEDULE schedule
	ON COMPLETION PRESERVE
	DO
		body of event e.g. INSERT INTO ...;
	- ON COMPLETION PRESERVE retains the event
	- can use relative schedules, e.g. CURRENT_TIMESTAMP + INTERVAL 1 MINUTE
	- example recurring schedule:
	ON SCHEDULE EVERY 1 MINUTE
	STARTS CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
	ENDS CURRENT_TIMESTAMP + INTERVAL 1 HOUR
	- to drop an event:
	DROP EVENT event_name
