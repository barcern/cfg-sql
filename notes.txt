Session 1 notes
- big data = structured or unstructured data difficult to process using standard techniques
- capture > store > analyse
- database = data storage
- SQL = for data access and processing
- examples of common streams
	- software engineering: programming and development
	- data analysis: data science and processing
- data science steps
	- frame the problem to solve
	- collect and store raw data
	- process the data
	- explore the data
	- in-depth analysis
	- communicate and visualise results
- database
	- multiple tables within database, can relate to one another
- relational database model RDBM
	- stores data in tables, which relates pieces of data to one another
	- tables
		- consist of rows (often called records) and columns
		- junction table: combinations of other tables, e.g. which employee is in which department, 
		cannot exist without employee or department tables
		- need to specify constraints per column: type of data (mandatory), size of data, format, 
		required (not null) or not (null)
		- NULL value - process cell without data without problems, must explicitly include
		- data types (more info here: https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_datatypes.asp)
			- char(size) i.e. fixed length string, can be from 0 to 255, 1 by default
			- varchar(size) i.e. variable length string, can be from 0 to 65535
			- binary
			- float(p) where p is precision
			- decimal(m,d) where m is total digits and d is digits after decimal
			- boolean where 0 is FALSE and all other values are TRUE
			- date i.e. YYYY-MM-DD
			- time i.e. HH:MM:SS
			- timestamp i.e. YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
	- attribute = property of an object, e.g. data hired, date of birth, can identify using an attribute
	- many to many relationships allowed, e.g. can have many salaries to account for pay rise
	- https://coderpad.io/sandbox
- relational database management system RDBMS
	- program to create, update and administer a relational db_name
	- SQL (Structured Query Language) most commonly used language
	- MySQL
		- most popular open source SQL db
		- easy to use, inexpensive, reliable, large community
		- poor performance when scaling, open source dev slow, missing some advanced features
		- controlled by Oracle
	- PostgreSQL
		- open source, not controlled by any corporation, used for web app dev
		- easy to use, inexpensive, reliable, large community, some additional features
		- slower performance, not as commonly offered as managed instance
	- Oracle DB
		- close source (Oracle)
		- large apps (banking - prebuilt functionality)
		- expensive
	- SQL Server
		- close source (Microsoft)
		- large enterprise apps
		- expensive
	- SQLite
		- open source
		- can store an entire db in a single file so data can be stored locally e.g. db in mobile phone
- https://coderpad.io/sandbox to practice online
- data in db
	- should be singular source of truth
	- should be easy to query
	- want to manage and maintain data efficiently
	- want to persist data and keep it safe
- query syntax
	keyword identifier keyword identifier;
- SELECT syntax
	- SELECT column_name1, column_name2 FROM table_name;
	- SELECT * FROM table_name; where * is a wildcard character to select all columns from a table
	- SELECT table.column1, table.column2 FROM table;
	- SELECT t.column1, t.column2 FROM table t;
	- can alias a table using ... FROM table t;
- CREATE DATABASE and USE db syntax
	- CREATE DATABASE db_name; not SQL standard
	- USE db_name;
	  SELECT * FROM table_name;
	- SELECT * FROM db_name.table_name;
- CREATE TABLE syntax
	- CREATE TABLE table_name (column1 INTEGER, column2 VARCHAR(50), column3 VARCHAR(50), column4 INTEGER); 
	define name and type at min
- INSERT INTO syntax
	- populate tables with data, i.e. add new rows of data
	- keep names clear and user-friendly
	- INSERT INTO table_name (col1, col2, col3) VALUES (val1, val2, val3);
- INSERT INTO syntax pt 2
	- insert multiple rows with one statement
	- INSERT INTO table_name (col1, col2, col3) VALUES (val1,val2,val3), (val4,val5,val6), (val7,val8,val9);
	- INSERT INTO table_name (col1, col2, col3) SELECT * FROM old_table_name WHERE old_table_name.col>10;
- homework task 1
	- review slide in reference materials - done
	- write a paragraph about what I want to do with SQL - done
- homework task 2
	- create sweet and savoury tables in bakery database - done
	- create parts database - done

Session 2 notes
- DISTINCT
	- keyword requesting a unique set of results
	- SELECT DISTINCT alias.column_name FROM table_name alias;
- WHERE
	- checks for conditions to match for results to qualify
	- comes after FROM
	- Boolean expression, such as =, !=, >, < etc.
	- SELECT alias.column_name FROM table_name alias WHERE alias.column_name = 'value';
- database normalisation
	- create table about one specific topic only (nonstructured data -> structured data)
	- benefits
		- minimise duplicate data
		- minimise/avoid data modification issues
		- simplify queries
		- i.e. reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity
		- + reduce data complexity, ensure relationship between tables as well as data, 
		ensure data dependecies and data are logically stored
	- common forms 
		- 1st (or 1NF)
			- contains only automic values (i.e. one value per cell)
			- each record is unique, no repeating groups (i.e. table doesn't contain 2 or more
			values of columns that are closely related)
		- 2nd (or 2NF)
			- 1NF
			- no partial dependency of any column on primary key
			- all non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on primary key
		- 3rd (or 3NF)
			- 2NF
			- no transitive functional dependency, i.e. table 1 dependent on table 2 and table 2
			dependent on table 3 is transitive dependence, which isn't allowed to occur
			- benefits: data integrity, no data duplication
		- Boyce-Codd (or BCNF or 3.5NF)
			- used to handle anomalies which are not accounted for in 3NF
			- all redundancy based on functional dependecy removed
- SQL constraint types
	- constraints = rules to restrict type of data in a table
	- ensure accuracy and reliability of data in table
	- can be set at column or table level
	- constraint violation > action aborted
	- CREATE TABLE table_name (col1 Type, col2 Type, col3 Type, 
	CONSTRAINT contstraint_name constraint_type (col_that_it_applies_to));
	- CREATE TABLE customers (customer_id INTEGER, name VARCHAR(50), 
	surname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, telephone INTEGER CONSTRAINT pk_customer_id PRIMARY KEY (customer_id));
	- NOT NULL
		- once applied, cannot pass a null value to the column
		- cannot be defined at table level
		- CREATE TABLE table_name (col1 INTEGER NOT NULL, col2 VARCHAR(50));
	- UNIQUE
		- column must only have unique values, i.e. duplicate values not allowed
		- can be applied at column or table level
		- CREATE TABLE table_name (col1 INTEGER NOT NULL UNIQUE, col2 VARCHAR(50));
		- ALTER TABLE table_name ADD UNIQUE (col1);
	- CHECK
		- restrict value of a column between a range
		- CREATE TABLE table_name (col1 INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (col1 > 0), col2 VARCHAR(50));
		- ALTER TABLE table_name ADD CHECK (col1 > 0);
	- DEFAULT
		- set default value for column
		- CREATE TABLE table_name (col1 INTEGER NOT NULL UNIQUE, col2 VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'value');
	- PRIMARY KEY
		= unique identifier of row per table, can be used to refer to other tables
		- cannot be null
		- must be unique
		- can be single or multiple columns (called compound key)
		- can be defined in CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE statements as PRIMARY KEY
		- CREATE TABLE table_name (col1 Type KEY DEFINITION, col2 Type, col3 Type);
		- CREATE TABLE customers (customer_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(50), 
		surname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, telephone INTEGER);
		- CREATE TABLE table_name (col1 Type, col2 Type, CONSTRAINT pk_name PRIMARY KEY col1);
	- FOREIGN KEY
		- relates two tables, refers to a column (often primary key) in a different table
		- restricts actions that would destroy links between tables
		- enforces referential integrity, reinforces relationships between tables (parent/referenced 
		and child/referencing tables)
		- can be non-unique
		- allows null values
		- called recursive/self-referencing foreign key if primary key and foreign key in same table
		- to insert foreign key value into child table, that value must be present in parent table
		- table can have more than one foreign key, and each can refer to a different parent table
		- when record deleted in parent table 
			- ON DELETE CASCADE - remove record from child table
			- ON DELETE SET NULL - set record to NULL in child table
			- otherwise not allowed to delete in parent table
		- define ON DELETE and ON UPDATE actions
			- CASCADE - push change from parent table to child table
			- SET NULL - if value changed in parent table, set to NULL in child table
			- RESTRICT - parent value cannot be edited, default
		- CREATE TABLE table_name (col1 Type PRIMARY KEY, col2 Type, 
		col3 Type FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES table_name2 (col2) ON UPDATE CASCADE ON DELETE CASCADE);
		- ALTER TABLE table_name ADD CONSTRAINT constraint_name FOREIGN KEY (col_that_it_applies_to)
		REFERENCES table_name2 (col2_that_it_applies_to);
		- ALTER TABLE table_name DROP FOREIGN KEY constraint_name; to drop foreign key
		- SET foreign_key_checks = 0; to disable foreign key checks
		- SET foreign_key_check = 1; to enable foreign key checks
- data integrity
	- parent table with unique primary keys
	- referential integrity - aggregate information across sources
	- child table with its own primary key and a foreign key to link back to parent table
- database relationships
	- one to one
	- one to many
	- many to many
	- many to one
- core commands DDL
	- DDL = Data Definition Language
	- subset of SQL statements that change structure of db schema
	- CREATE
	- ALTER TABLE
		- change an existing table, add/remove columns, change data type, change constraints
		- must agree with current data
		- ALTER TABLE table_name ADD CONSTRAINT constraint_name constraint_type (col_that_it_applies_to)
		REFERENCES table_name2 (col2_that_it_applies_to);
	- DROP TABLE
		- removes table and all associated data
		- error if table is a foreign key to another table

	- TRUNCATE
	- COMMENT
	- RENAME
- DML commands
	- DML = Data Manipulation Language

	- INSERT
	- UPDATE
		- modify columns in a single 
		- use SET and WHERE keywords
		- UPDATE table_name SET table_name.col1 = new_value WHERE table_name.col2 = value;
