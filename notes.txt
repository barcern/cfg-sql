Session 1 notes
- big data = structured or unstructured data difficult to process using standard techniques
- capture > store > analyse
- database = data storage
- SQL = for data access and processing
- examples of common streams
	- software engineering: programming and development
	- data analysis: data science and processing
- data science steps
	- frame the problem to solve
	- collect and store raw data
	- process the data
	- explore the data
	- in-depth analysis
	- communicate and visualise results
- database
	- multiple tables within database, can relate to one another
- relational database model RDBM
	- stores data in tables, which relates pieces of data to one another
	- tables
		- consist of rows (often called records) and columns
		- junction table: combinations of other tables, e.g. which employee is in which department, cannot exist without employee or department tables
		- need to specify constraints per column: type of data (mandatory), size of data, format, required (not null) or not (null)
		- NULL value - process cell without data without problems, must explicitly include
		- data types (more info here: https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_datatypes.asp)
			- char(size) i.e. fixed length string, can be from 0 to 255, 1 by default
			- varchar(size) i.e. variable length string, can be from 0 to 65535
			- binary
			- float(p) where p is precision
			- decimal(m,d) where m is total digits and d is digits after decimal
			- boolean where 0 is FALSE and all other values are TRUE
			- date i.e. YYYY-MM-DD
			- time i.e. HH:MM:SS
			- timestamp i.e. YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
	- attribute = property of an object, e.g. data hired, date of birth, can identify using an attribute
	- many to many relationships allowed, e.g. can have many salaries to account for pay rise

- relational database management system RDBMS
	- program to create, update and administer a relational db_name
	- SQL (Structured Query Language) most commonly used language
	- MySQL
		- most popular open source SQL db
		- easy to use, inexpensive, reliable, large community
		- poor performance when scaling, open source dev slow, missing some advanced features
		- controlled by Oracle
	- PostgreSQL
		- open source, not controlled by any corporation, used for web app dev
		- easy to use, inexpensive, reliable, large community, some additional features
		- slower performance, not as commonly offered as managed instance
	- Oracle DB
		- close source (Oracle)
		- large apps (banking - prebuilt functionality)
		- expensive
	- SQL Server
		- close source (Microsoft)
		- large enterprise apps
		- expensive
	- SQLite
		- open source
		- can store an entire db in a single file so data can be stored locally e.g. db in mobile phone
- https://coderpad.io/sandbox to practice online
- data in db
	- should be singular source of truth
	- should be easy to query
	- want to manage and maintain data efficiently
	- want to persist data and keep it safe
- query syntax
	keyword identifier keyword identifier;
- SELECT syntax
	- SELECT column_name1, column_name2 FROM table_name;
	- SELECT * FROM table_name; where * is a wildcard character to select all columns from a table
	- SELECT table.column1, table.column2 FROM table;
	- SELECT t.column1, t.column2 FROM table t;
	- can alias a table using ... FROM table t;
- CREATE DATABASE and USE db syntax
	- CREATE DATABASE db_name; not SQL standard
	- USE db_name;
	  SELECT * FROM table_name;
	- SELECT * FROM db_name.table_name;
- CREATE TABLE syntax
	- CREATE TABLE table_name (column1 INTEGER, column2 VARCHAR(50), column3 VARCHAR(50), column4 INTEGER); define name and type at min
- INSERT INTO syntax
	- populate tables with data, i.e. add new rows of data
	- keep names clear and user-friendly
	- INSERT INTO table_name (col1, col2, col3) VALUES (val1, val2, val3);
- INSERT INTO syntax pt 2
	- insert multiple rows with one statement
	- INSERT INTO table_name (col1, col2, col3) VALUES (val1,val2,val3), (val4,val5,val6), (val7,val8,val9);
	- INSERT INTO table_name (col1, col2, col3) SELECT * FROM old_table_name WHERE old_table_name.col>10;
- homework task 1
	- review slide in reference materials - done
	- write a paragraph about what I want to do with SQL - done
- homework task 2
	- create sweet and savoury tables in bakery database - done
	- create parts database - done
	
Session 2 notes
- DISTINCT
	- keyword with query asking for a unique set of results
	- SELECT DISTINCT alias.column_name FROM table_name alias;
- WHERE
	- checks for conditions to match for results to qualify
	- comes after FROM
	- Boolean expression, such as =, !=, >, < etc.
	- SELECT alias.column_name FROM table_name alias WHERE alias.name = 'value';
- database normalisation
	- create table about one specific topic only
	- benefits
		- minimise duplicate data
		- minimise/avoid data modification issues
		- simplify queries
	- common forms 
		- 1st, 2nd and 3rd normal form
		- 1NF, 2NF and 3NF
- SQL constraint types
	- constraints = rules to apply on type of data in a table
	- ensure accuracy and reliability of data in table
	- constraint violation > action aborted
	- CREATE TABLE table_name (col1 Type, col2 Type, col3 Type, CONSTRAINT contstraint_name constraint_type (col_that_it_applies_to));
	- CREATE TABLE customers (customer_id INTEGER, name VARCHAR(50), 
	surname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, telephone INTEGER CONSTRAINT pk_customer_id PRIMARY KEY (customer_id));
	- PRIMARY KEY = unique identifier per table, can be used to refer to other tables
		- cannot be null
		- must be unique
		- can be multiple columns - called compound key
		- can be defined in CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE statements as PRIMARY KEY
		- CREATE TABLE table_name (col1 Type KEY DEFINITION, col2 Type, col3 Type);
		- CREATE TABLE customers (customer_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(50), 
		surname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, telephone INTEGER);
	- FOREIGN KEY
		- refers to a primary key in a different table
		- can be non-unique
		- allows null values
- data integrity
	- parent table with unique primary keys
	- referential integrity - aggregate information across sources
	- child table with its own primary key and a foreign key to link back to parent table
- database relationships
	- one to one
	- one to many
	- many to many
	- many to one
- core commands DDL
	- DDL = Data Definition Language
	- SELECT
	- INSERT
	- UPDATE
		- modify columns in a single 
		- UPDATE table_name SET table_name.col1 = new_value WHERE table_name.col2 = value;
	- DELETE
		- delete one or more rows
		- DELETE FROM table_name; to empty table permanently
		- DELETE FROM table_name WHERE table_name.col = value;
	- ALTER TABLE
		- change an existing table, add/remove columns, change data type, change constraints
		- ALTER TABLE table_name ADD CONSTRAINT constraint_name constraint_type (col_that_it_applies_to)
		REFERENCES table_name2 (col2_that_it_applies_to);
	- DROP TABLE
		- removes table and all associated data
		- error if table is a foreign key to another table
		- DROP TABLE table_name;
- homework task 1
	- review slides
	- write queries for parts db
- homework task 2
	- create shop db with tables
