project name:
	- Bracknell Bees Progress Tracker

project idea:
	- database to keep track of stats relating to my local ice hockey team (Bracknell Bees)

summary:
	this database will hold multiple tables, describing metrics about the players
	themselves, keeping stats about each game played this season, top scoring players,
	players of the match, and (only if I have lots of free time) some prediction 
	mechanism on winning based on previous results with each team

tables:
	- team: team_id, team name, location - data done
	- player: team, player_id, name, nationality, position etc. - data done
	- game: game_id, away/home, win/loss, man of match, end type (ft, etc.), shots sent, shots received
	- penalty: penalty_id, game_id, type, length, player_id - what do I do about other team's penalties?
	- scoring: score_id, game_id, player_id, time, period
	- netminders: player_id, game_id, time, goals
	- standing: game_id, points scored, number in league, team1, team2, team who scored, date

import data as csv

ideas:
	- view for standings
	- procedure to calculate standings
	- count per periods
