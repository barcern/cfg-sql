project name:
	- Bracknell Bees Progress Tracker

project idea:
	- database to keep track of stats relating to my local ice hockey team (Bracknell Bees)

summary:
	this database will hold multiple tables, describing metrics about the players
	themselves, keeping stats about each game played this season, top scoring players,
	players of the match, and (only if I have lots of free time) some prediction 
	mechanism on winning based on previous results with each team

tables:
	- player: player_id, name, nationality, position
	- game: game_id, away/home, win/loss, man of match, end type (ft, etc.)
	- penalty: penalty_id, game_id, type, length, player_id - what do I do about other team's penalties?
	- scoring: score_id, game_id, player_id
