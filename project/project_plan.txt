Project name:
Bracknell Bees Progress Tracker

Project idea:
database to keep track of stats relating to my local ice hockey team (Bracknell Bees)

Summary:
this database will hold multiple tables, describing metrics about the players
themselves, keeping stats about each game played this season, top scoring players,
players of the match, and (only if I have lots of free time) some prediction 
mechanism on winning based on previous results with each team
